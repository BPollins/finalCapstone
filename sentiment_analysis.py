# Task 21 - Capstone Project

# Create a program that performs sentiment analysis on Amazon product reviews

# Import packages

import spacy
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from spacytextblob.spacytextblob import SpacyTextBlob

# Import model and data

nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')
nlp.add_pipe('spacytextblob')

raw_data = pd.read_csv('amazon_product_reviews.csv')

# Clean data by dropping NaN values from the 'reviews.text' column and removing stopwords from the entries (this step takes a while...)

reviews = pd.DataFrame()

reviews['raw_review'] = raw_data['reviews.text'].dropna()

    # This step splits the individual reviews into a list of tokens (if they are not stop words) and then joins them back together as a string

reviews['clean_review'] = reviews['raw_review'].apply(lambda text: ' '.join([token.text.lower() for token in nlp(text) if not token.is_stop]))

#Â Define 'sentiment' function that returns the polarity of a given review and categorises the review accordingly

def sentiment(text):
    doc = nlp(text)
    polarity = doc._.blob.polarity

    if polarity <= -0.6:
        sentiment = 'Very Negative'
    elif polarity <= -0.2:
        sentiment = 'Negative'
    elif polarity <= 0.2:
        sentiment = 'Neutral'
    elif polarity <= 0.6:
        sentiment = 'Positive'
    else:
        sentiment = 'Very Positive'
    
    return sentiment

# Select 5 random reviews and return their predicted polarity

sample = reviews.sample(5)

for i in range(5):
    print('------------------')
    print(f'Review: {sample.raw_review.iloc[i]}')
    print(f'Sentiment: {sentiment(sample.clean_review.iloc[i])}')
